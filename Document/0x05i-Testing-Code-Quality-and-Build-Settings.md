## Testing Code Quality and Build Settings of Android Apps

### Verifying That the App is Properly Signed

#### Overview

Android requires that all APKs be digitally signed with a certificate before they can be installed. The digital signature is required by the Android system before installing/running an application, and it's also used to verify the identity of the owner for future updates of the application. This process can prevent an app from being tampered with, or modified to include malicious code.

When an APK is signed, a public-key certificate is attached to the APK. This certificate uniquely associates the APK to the developer and their corresponding private key. When building an app in debug mode, the Android SDK signs the app with a debug key specifically created for debugging purposes. An app signed with a debug key is not be meant for distribution and won't be accepted in most app stores, including the Google Play Store. To prepare the app for final release, the app must be signed with a release key belonging to the developer.

The final release build of an app must be signed with a valid release key. Note that Android expects any updates to the app to be signed with the same certificate, so a validity period of 25 years or more is recommended. Apps published on Google Play must be signed with a certificate that is valid at least until October 22th, 2033.

Two APK signing schemes are available: JAR signing (v1 scheme) APK Signature Scheme v2 (v2 scheme). The v2 signature, which is supported by Android 7.0 and higher, offers improved security and performance. Release builds should always be signed using *both* schemes.

#### Static Analysis

Verify that the release build is signed with both v1 and v2 scheme, and that the code signing certificate contained in the APK is belongs to the developer.

If you don't have the APK available locally, pull it from the device first:

```bash
$ adb shell pm list packages
(...)
package:com.awesomeproject
(...)
$ adb shell pm path com.awesomeproject
package:/data/app/com.awesomeproject-1/base.apk
$ adb pull /data/app/com.awesomeproject-1/base.apk
```

APK signatures can be verified using the <code>apksigner</code> tool.

```bash
$ apksigner verify --verbose Desktop/example.apk
Verifies
Verified using v1 scheme (JAR signing): true
Verified using v2 scheme (APK Signature Scheme v2): true
Number of signers: 1
```

The contents of the signing certificate can be examined using <code>jarsigner</code>. Note the in the debug certificate, the Common Name(CN) attribute is set to "Android Debug".

The output for an APK signed with a Debug certificate looks as follows:

```
$ jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs example.apk

sm     11116 Fri Nov 11 12:07:48 ICT 2016 AndroidManifest.xml

      X.509, CN=Android Debug, O=Android, C=US
      [certificate is valid from 3/24/16 9:18 AM to 8/10/43 9:18 AM]
      [CertPath not validated: Path does not chain with any of the trust anchors]
(...)
```

Ignore the "CertPath not validated" error -  this error appears with Java SDK 7 and greater. Instead, you can rely on the <code>apksigner</code> to verify the certificate chain.

#### Dynamic Analysis

Static analysis should be used to verify the APK signature.

#### Remediation

Developers need to make sure that release builds are signed with the appropriate certificate from the release keystore. In Android Studio, this can be done manually or by creating a signing configuration and assigning it to the release build type<sup>[2]</sup>.

The signing configuration can be managed through the Android Studio GUI or the <code>signingConfigs {}</code> block in <code>build.gradle</code>. The following values need to be set to activate both v1 and v2 scheme:

```
v1SigningEnabled true
v2SigningEnabled true
```

### Testing If the App is Debuggable

#### Overview

The <code>android:debuggable</code> attribute in the <code>Application</code> tag in the Manifest determines whether or not the app can be debugged when running on a user mode build of Android. In a release build, this attribute should always be set to "false" (the default value).

#### Static Analysis

Check in <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> whether the <code>android:debuggable</code> attribute is set:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="no"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" package="com.android.owasp">

    ...

    <application android:allowBackup="true" android:debuggable="true" android:icon="@drawable/ic_launcher" android:label="@string/app_name" android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
        <meta-data android:name="com.owasp.main" android:value=".Hook"/>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

#### Dynamic Analysis

Drozer can be used to identify if an application is debuggable. The module `app.package.attacksurface` displays information about IPC components exported by the application, in addition to whether the app is debuggable.

```
dz> run app.package.attacksurface com.mwr.dz
Attack Surface:
  1 activities exported
  1 broadcast receivers exported
  0 content providers exported
  0 services exported
    is debuggable
```

To scan for all debuggable applications on a device, the `app.package.debuggable` module should be used:

```
dz> run app.package.debuggable
Package: com.mwr.dz
  UID: 10083
  Permissions:
   - android.permission.INTERNET
Package: com.vulnerable.app
  UID: 10084
  Permissions:
   - android.permission.INTERNET
```

If an application is debuggable, it is trivial to get command execution in the context of the application. In `adb` shell, execute the `run-as` binary, followed by the package name and command:

```
$ run-as com.vulnerable.app id
uid=10084(u0_a84) gid=10084(u0_a84) groups=10083(u0_a83),1004(input),1007(log),1011(adb),1015(sdcard_rw),1028(sdcard_r),3001(net_bt_admin),3002(net_bt),3003(inet),3006(net_bw_stats) context=u:r:untrusted_app:s0:c512,c768
```

An alternative method to determine if an application is debuggable, is to attach jdb to the running process. If debugging is disabled, this should fail with an error.

#### Remediation

In the `AndroidManifest.xml` file, set the `android:debuggable` flag to false, as shown below:

```xml
<application android:debuggable="false">
...
</application>
```

### Testing for Debugging Symbols

#### Overview

-- TODO [Give an overview about the functionality and it's potential weaknesses] --

For native binaries, use a standard tool like nm or objdump to inspect the symbol table. A release build should generally not contain any debugging symbols. If the goal is to obfuscate the library, removing unneeded dynamic symbols is also recommended.

#### Static Analysis

Symbols  are usually stripped during the build process, so you need the compiled byte-code and libraries to verify whether the any unnecessary metadata has been discarded.

To display debug symbols:

```bash
export $NM = $ANDROID_NDK_DIR/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-nm
```

```bash
$ $NM -a libfoo.so
/tmp/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-nm: libfoo.so: no symbols
```
To display dynamic symbols:

```bash
$ $NM -D libfoo.so
```

Alternatively, open the file in your favorite disassembler and check the symbol tables manually.

#### Dynamic Analysis

Static analysis should be used to verify for debugging symbols.

#### Remediation

Dynamic symbols can be stripped using the <code>visibility</code> compiler flag. Adding this flag causes gcc to discard the function names while still preserving the names of functions declared as <code>JNIEXPORT</code>.

Add the following to build.gradle:

```
        externalNativeBuild {
            cmake {
                cppFlags "-fvisibility=hidden"
            }
        }
```

### Testing for Debugging Code and Verbose Error Logging

#### Overview
StrictMode is a developer tool to be able to detect policy violation, e.g. disk or network access.
It can be implemented in order to check the usage of good coding practices such as implementing high-performance code or usage of network access on the main thread.
The policy are defined together with rules and different methods of showing the violation of a policy.

There are two category of policies:
* `StrictMode.ThreadPolicy`
* `StrictMode.VmPolicy`

The ThreadPolicy can monitor:
* Disk Reads
* Disk Writes
* Network access
* Custom Slow Code

The VM policies,  applied to all threads in the virtual machine's process, are:
* Leaked Activity objects
* Leaked SQLite objects
* Leaked Closable objects

In order to enable `StrictMode`, the code should be implemented in onCreate().
Here is an example of enabling both policies mentioned above<sup>[1]</sup>:
```
public void onCreate() {
     if (DEVELOPER_MODE) {
         StrictMode.setThreadPolicy(new StrictMode.ThreadPolicy.Builder()
                 .detectDiskReads()
                 .detectDiskWrites()
                 .detectNetwork()   // or .detectAll() for all detectable problems
                 .penaltyLog()
                 .build());
         StrictMode.setVmPolicy(new StrictMode.VmPolicy.Builder()
                 .detectLeakedSqlLiteObjects()
                 .detectLeakedClosableObjects()
                 .penaltyLog()
                 .penaltyDeath()
                 .build());
     }
     super.onCreate();
 }

```
#### Static Analysis
With the purpose to check if `StrictMode` is enabled you could look for the methods `StrictMode.setThreadPolicy` or `StrictMode.setVmPolicy`. Most likely they will be in the onCreate() method.

The various detect methods for Thread Policy are<sup>[3]</sup>:
```
detectDiskWrites() //API level 9
detectDiskReads() //API level 9
detectNetwork() //API level 9
detectCustomSlowCalls()//Introduced in API level 11
detectAll()
detectCustomSlowCalls()
```

Another possibility is to capture all kind of violation as:
```
detectAll()
detectCustomSlowCalls()
```

The possible penalties for thread policy are<sup>[3]</sup>:
```
penaltyLog() //Logs a message to LogCat
penaltyDeath() //Crashes application, runs at the end of all enabled penalties
penaltyDialog() //Show a dialog
penaltyDeathOnNetwork() //Crashes the whole process on any network usage
penaltyDropBox() //Enable detected violations log a stacktrace and timing data to the DropBox on policy violation
penaltyFlashScreen() //Introduced in API level 11 which Flash the screen during a violation
```

Considering the VM policy of StrictMode, the policy are<sup>[3]</sup>:
```
detectActivityLeaks() //API level 11. Detect leaks of Activity subclasses.
detectLeakedClosableObjects() //API level 11. Detect when an Closeable or other object with a explict termination method is finalized without having been closed.
detectLeakedSqlLiteObjects() //API level 9. Detect when an SQLiteCursor or other SQLite object is finalized without having been closed.
setClassInstanceLimit(Class.forName("my.app.sample.sampleclass"),10) //API level 11
```

The possible penalties for VM policy violation are<sup>[3]</sup>:
```
penaltyLog()
penaltyDeath()
penaltyDropBox()
```

#### Dynamic Analysis
There are different way of detecting the `StrictMode` and it depends on how the policies' role are implemented. Some of them are:
* Logcat
* Warning Dialog
* Crash of the application

#### Remediation
It's recommended to insert the policy in the `if` statement with `DEVELOPER_MODE` as condition.
The DEVELOPER_MODE has to be disabled for release build in order to disable `StrictMode` too.

### Testing Exception Handling

#### Overview
Exceptions can often occur when an application gets into a non-normal or erroneous state. Both in Java and C++ exceptions can be thrown when such state occurs.
Testing exception handling is about reassuring that the application will handle the exception and get to a safe state without exposing any sensitive information at both the UI and the logging mechanisms used by the application.

#### Static Analysis

Review the source code to understand and identify how the application handles various types of errors (IPC communications, remote services invocation, etc). Here are some examples of the checks to be performed at this stage :

* Verify that the application use a well-designed and unified scheme to handle exceptions<sup>[1]</sup>.
* Verify that standard `RuntimeException`s (e.g.`NullPointerException`, `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, `ActivityNotFoundException`, `CancellationException`, `SQLException`) are anticipated upon by creating proper null-checks, bound-checks and alike. See <sup>[2]</sup> for an overview of the provided child-classes of `RuntimeException`. If the developer still throws a child of `RuntimeException` then this should always be intentional and that intention should be handled by the calling method.
* Verify that for every non-runtime `Throwable`, there is a proper catch handler, which ends up handling the actual exception properly.
* Verify that the application doesn't expose sensitive information while handling exceptions in its UI or in its log-statements, but are still verbose enough to explain the issue to the user.
* Verify that any confidential information, such as keying material and/or authentication information is always wiped at the `finally` blocks in case of a high risk application.


#### Dynamic Analysis
There are various ways of doing dynamic analysis:

- Use Xposed to hook into methods and call the method with unexpected values or overwrite existing variables to unexpected values (e.g. Null values, etc.).
- Provide unexpected values to UI fields in the Android application.
- Interact with the application using its intents and public providers by using values that are unexpected.
- Tamper the network communication and/or the files stored by the application.

In all cases, the application should not crash, but instead, it should:

- Recover from the error or get into a state in which it can inform the user of not being able to continue.
- If necessary, inform the user in an informative message to make him/her take appropriate action. The message itself should not leak sensitive information.
- Not provide any information in logging mechanims used by the application.

#### Remediation
There are a few things a developer can do:
- Ensure that the application use a well-designed and unified scheme to handle exceptions<sup>[1]</sup>.
- When an exception is thrown, make sure that the application has centralized handlers for exceptions that result in similar behavior. This can be a static class for instance. For specific exceptions given the methods context, specific catch blocks should be provided.
- When executing operations that involve high risk information, make sure you wipe the information in the finally block in java:

```java
byte[] secret;
try{
	//use secret
} catch (SPECIFICEXCEPTIONCLASS | SPECIFICEXCEPTIONCLASS2  e) {
	// handle any issues
} finally {
	//clean the secret.
}
```

- Add a general exception-handler for uncaught exceptions to clear out the state of the application prior to a crash:
```java
public class MemoryCleanerOnCrash implements Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler {

    private static final MemoryCleanerOnCrash S_INSTANCE = new MemoryCleanerOnCrash();
    private final List<Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler> mHandlers = new ArrayList<>();

	//initiaze the handler and set it as the default exception handler
    public static void init() {
        S_INSTANCE.mHandlers.add(Thread.getDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler());
        Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(S_INSTANCE);
    }

	 //make sure that you can still add exception handlers on top of it (required for ACRA for instance)
    public void subscribeCrashHandler(Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler handler) {
        mHandlers.add(handler);
    }

    @Override
    public void uncaughtException(Thread thread, Throwable ex) {

			//handle the cleanup here
			//....
			//and then show a message to the user if possible given the context

        for (Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler handler : mHandlers) {
            handler.uncaughtException(thread, ex);
        }
    }
}
```

Now you need to call the initializer for the handler at your custom `Application` class (e.g. the class that extends `Application`):

```java

	 @Override
    protected void attachBaseContext(Context base) {
        super.attachBaseContext(base);
        MemoryCleanerOnCrash.init();
    }
```

### Verify That Free Security Features Are Activated

#### Overview

As Java classes are trivial to decompile, applying some basic obfuscation to the release bytecode is recommended. For Java apps on Android, ProGuard offers an easy way to shrink and obfuscate code. It replaces identifiers such as class names, method names and variable names with meaningless character combinations. This is a form of layout obfuscation, which is “free” in that it doesn't impact the performance of the program.

Since most Android applications are Java based, they are immune<sup>[1]</sup> to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.


#### Static Analysis

If source code is provided, the build.gradle file can be checked to see if obfuscation settings are applied. From the example below, you can see that `minifyEnabled` and `proguardFiles` are set. It is common to create exceptions for some classes from obfuscation with "-keepclassmembers" and "-keep class". Therefore it is important to audit the ProGuard configuration file to see what classes are exempted. The `getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt')` method gets the default ProGuard settings from the `<Android SDK>/tools/proguard/` folder. The file `proguard-rules.pro` is where you define custom ProGuard rules. From our sample `proguard-rules.pro` file, you can see that many classes that extend common android classes are exempted, which should be done more granular on specific classes or libraries.

build.gradle
```
android {
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'),
                    'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

proguard-rules.pro
```
-keep public class * extends android.app.Activity
-keep public class * extends android.app.Application
-keep public class * extends android.app.Service
```

#### Dynamic Analysis

If source code is not provided, an APK can be decompiled to verify if the codebase has been obfuscated. dex2jar can be used to convert dex code to jar file. Tools like JD-GUI can be used to check if class, method and variable name is human readable.

Sample obfuscated code block
```
package com.a.a.a;

import com.a.a.b.a;
import java.util.List;

class a$b
  extends a
{
  public a$b(List paramList)
  {
    super(paramList);
  }

  public boolean areAllItemsEnabled()
  {
    return true;
  }

  public boolean isEnabled(int paramInt)
  {
    return true;
  }
}
```

#### Remediation

ProGuard should be used to strip unneeded debugging information from the Java bytecode. By default, ProGuard removes attributes that are useful for debugging, including line numbers, source file names and variable names. ProGuard is a free Java class file shrinker, optimizer, obfuscate and pre-verifier. It is shipped with Android’s SDK tools. To activate shrinking for the release build, add the following to build.gradle:

```
android {
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile(‘proguard-android.txt'),
                    'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
    ...
}
```
