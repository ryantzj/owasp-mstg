## Testing Cryptography in iOS Apps

In the chapter "Testing Cryptography in Mobile Apps", we introduced general cryptography best practices and described typical flaws that can occur when cryptography is used incorrectly in mobile apps. In this chapter, we'll go into more detail on the cryptography APIs available on iOS. We'll show how identify uses of those APIs in the source code and how to interpret the configuration. When reviewing code, make sure to compare the cryptographic parameters used with the current best practices linked from this guide.

### Verifying the Configuration of Cryptographic Standard Algorithms

#### Overview

Apple provides libraries with implementations of most commonly used cryptographic algorithms. A good point of reference is [Apple's Cryptographic Services Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/cryptoservices/GeneralPurposeCrypto/GeneralPurposeCrypto.html "Apple Cryptographic Services Guide"). It contains broad documentation on how to use standard libraries to initialize and use cryptographic primitives, which is also useful when performing source code analysis.
For dynamic testing, more useful is native C API, for instance CommonCryptor, that is most frequently used when performing cryptographic operations. Source code is partially available at the [Apple open source repository](https://opensource.apple.com "Apple Open Source").

#### Static Analysis

The main goal of static analysis is to ensure the following:

- Cryptographic algorithms are up to date and in-line with industry standards. This includes, but is not limited to outdated block ciphers (e.g. DES), stream ciphers (e.g. RC4), as well as hash functions (e.g. MD5) and broken random number generators like Dual_EC_DRBG (even if they are NIST certified). All of these should be marked as insecure and should not be used and removed from the application and server.
- Key lengths are in-line with industry standards and provide protection for sufficient amount of time. A comparison of different key lengths and protection they provide taking into account Moore's law is available [online](https://www.keylength.com/ "Keylength comparison").
- Cryptographic parameters are well defined within reasonable range. This includes, but is not limited to: cryptographic salt, which should be at least the same length as hash function output, reasonable choice of password derivation function and iteration count (e.g. PBKDF2, scrypt or bcrypt), IVs being random and unique, fit-for-purpose block encryption modes (e.g. ECB should not be used, except specific cases), key management being done properly (e.g. 3DES should have three independent keys) and so on.

If the app is using standard cryptographic implementations provided by Apple, the easiest way is to decompile the application and check for calls to functions from `CommonCryptor`, such as `CCCrypt`, `CCCryptorCreate`, etc. The [source code](https://opensource.apple.com/source/CommonCrypto/CommonCrypto-36064/CommonCrypto/CommonCryptor.h "CommonCryptor.h") contains signatures of all functions.
For instance, `CCCryptorCreate` has following signature:
```
CCCryptorStatus CCCryptorCreate(
	CCOperation op,             /* kCCEncrypt, etc. */
	CCAlgorithm alg,            /* kCCAlgorithmDES, etc. */
	CCOptions options,          /* kCCOptionPKCS7Padding, etc. */
	const void *key,            /* raw key material */
	size_t keyLength,
	const void *iv,             /* optional initialization vector */
	CCCryptorRef *cryptorRef);  /* RETURNED */
```

You can then compare all the `enum` types to understand which algorithm, padding and key material is being used. Pay attention to the keying material, if it's coming directly from a password (which is bad), or if it's coming from Key Generation Function (e.g. PBKDF2).
Obviously, there are other non-standard libraries that your application might be using (for instance `openssl`), so you should check for these too.

### Testing Random Number Generation

#### Overview

It is fundamentally impossible to produce truly random numbers on any deterministic device. Pseudo-random number generators (RNG) compensate for this by producing a stream of pseudo-random numbers - a stream of numbers that *appear* as if they were randomly generated. The quality of the generated numbers varies with the type of algorithm used. *Cryptographically secure* RNGs generate random numbers that pass statistical randomness tests, and are resilient against prediction attacks.

Mobile SDKs offer standard implementations of RNG algorithms that produce numbers with sufficient artificial randomness.

#### Analysis

Apple provides developers with the [Randomization Services](https://developer.apple.com/reference/security/randomization_services "Randomization Services") application programming interface (API) that generates cryptographically secure random numbers.

The Randomization Services API uses the `SecRandomCopyBytes` function to perform the numbers generation. This is a wrapper function for the `/dev/random` device file, which provides cryptographically secure pseudorandom value from 0 to 255 and performs concatenation.

Verify that all random numbers are generated using this API - there is no reason why developers should use a different one. 

In Swift, the [`SecRandomCopyBytes` API](https://developer.apple.com/reference/security/1399291-secrandomcopybytes "SecRandomCopyBytes (Swift)") is defined as follows:
```
func SecRandomCopyBytes(_ rnd: SecRandomRef?,
                      _ count: Int,
                      _ bytes: UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>) -> Int32
```

The [Objective-C version](https://developer.apple.com/reference/security/1399291-secrandomcopybytes?language=objc "SecRandomCopyBytes (Objective-C)") looks as follows:
```
int SecRandomCopyBytes(SecRandomRef rnd, size_t count, uint8_t *bytes);
```

The following is an example of its usage:
```
int result = SecRandomCopyBytes(kSecRandomDefault, 16, randomBytes);
```
